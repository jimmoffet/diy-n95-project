# DIY N95 Project
Design, fabrication and sourcing guidelines for masks and slip-covers made with MERV 14 or better materials. This project will initially focus on slip covers that extend the life of common N95 masks without compromising the facial seal provided by the underlying mask. Slip covers should be easy to manufacture at home with common tools and consumables (i.e. scissors and gel-based superglue). For those interested in specific differences between this design and NIOSH certified N95 masks, [see here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf12/K122702.pdf). Again, this is a not a replacement for an N95 mask, but for any healthcare professionals without access to approved masks and relying on DIY woven fabric designs, this is a superior alternative. The underlying filter material has been tested to provide >80% capture at 0.1 microns (unattached corona virions are ~.12 microns), compared to >95% for N95 masks. The >80% figure is based on performance tests of a single layer of MERV 16 filter material ~64sqft area configured in a baffle formation and subjected to typical commercial HVAC pressure. Your mileage may vary.

# Immediate Needs
If you have the capability to test these masks in a laboratory setting, please message me via github or contact info on my [website](https://www.jamesdavidmoffet.com). Scanned models or dimensionally accurate drawings of common N95 masks, specifically face seal shape and measurements. Note that models uploaded in the [init commit](https://github.com/jimmoffet/diy-n95-project/commit/122e8d2e49c9cc9eac42c34b83cf7c0b3a77745f) are likely not dimensionally-accurate.

Additional sources of MERV 14 or higher rated material in a usable format. A rating of 16 is probably the sweet spot in terms of cost and availability. Anything with an official HEPA rating is equivalent to 17 or higher. 

# Material Sourcing
Here's an example of [one viable sourcing option](https://www.samedaysupply.com/lennox-x5424-merv-16-replacement-filter-6-x-20-x-25). This provides approximately 2' by 32' of usable melt-blown filter material with minimal interference from pleating. With careful placement, this can produce over 100 double-layer templates. 

# Cost
Depending on the breaks, designs made from the above source should net out between 1 and 2 dollars each, with minimum expenditure of ~$120. Ideal for groups of volunteers.
