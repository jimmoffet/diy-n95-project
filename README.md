# DIY N95 Project
Design, fabrication and sourcing guidelines for masks and slip-covers made with MERV 14 or better materials. This project will initially focus on slip covers that extend the life of common N95 masks without compromising the facial seal provided by the underlying mask.

# Immediate Needs
Scanned models or dimensionally accurate drawings of common N95 masks.
Additional sources of MERV 14 or higher rated material in a usable format. Ratings of 16 or 17 are probably the sweet spot in terms of cost and availability. Anything with an official HEPA rating is 17 or higher. 

# Sourcing
Here's an example of a viable sourcing option: https://www.samedaysupply.com/lennox-x5425-merv-16-replacement-filter-6-x-17-x-28 

# Cost
Depending on the breaks, designs made from the above source should net out between 2 and 6 dollars each, without scale.
